Public - just has the main index.html file along with some that came with create-react-app.

Src - Has the source code of the entire project

tests - has all the tests and its data

api - has the api call to the endpoint

components - has all the main components

photos - has actions, actiontypes, reducer for photos component

stores - configures the main store for the app

styles - has the css file for the application

index.js (in src) and setupTests.js - entry to the application and set up of tests respectively.

### FUN FACT
Click the lendi tag on the navbar and see what happens! :)

### Technologies used:
* React
* Redux 
* Jest
* Enzyme

To ensure that the application loaded efficiently, client side lazy loading was used. To ensure responsiveness, bootsrap and react-bootstrap were used.

Install dependencies:

`yarn install` or `npm install`

Run:

`npm start`

### Testing

Tests were written using jest and enzyme. Snapshote and unit tests are written to ensure coverage. Other plugins were also used to ensure optimim output.

`yarn test` or `npm test`

##### Issues Encountered

Some 3rd party libraries are using an older versions of react,react-dom,react-test-renderer etc. This made snapshot testing  the app component quite challenging! 

Another challenge encountered was the testing of components that use redux. Enzyme and Jest had many configuration and setup blindspots which took a while to navigate. 

### Deployment

https://lendi.herokuapp.com/

###  Future work

One can never do enough to become the best! Ideally, over time I would like to add a feature that allows the user to select some of the albums. Furthermore, the app can be optimised further by testing all user interactions ( such as hover, scroll etc) and retreiving analytics on those actions! 

Thank you!
